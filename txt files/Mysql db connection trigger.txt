Using a MySQL event scheduler:

CREATE PROCEDURE python_code()
BEGIN
  -- Your Python code here
END;

CREATE EVENT date_trigger
ON SCHEDULE AT '2023-12-07 12:00:00'
DO
  CALL python_code();

Using a trigger with a temporary table:

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE date_table (
  date DATE NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO date_table (date) VALUES ('2023-12-07');

CREATE TRIGGER date_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON date_table FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF NEW.date = CURDATE() THEN
    -- Execute your Python code here
  END IF;
END;

sql:


DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER your_trigger_name
AFTER INSERT ON your_table
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Check the condition, replace 'your_date_column' and 'your_condition_date' accordingly
    IF NEW.your_date_column = 'your_condition_date' THEN
        -- Update a flag column or insert a record into another table
        -- For example, you can update a flag column 'trigger_executed' to 1
        UPDATE your_table SET trigger_executed = 1 WHERE id = NEW.id;
    END IF;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;



python:



import pymysql

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = pymysql.connect(host='your_host', user='your_user', password='your_password', database='your_database')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute a query to check the condition (replace 'your_table' and 'your_condition_column' accordingly)
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_condition_column = 'your_condition_value'")

# Fetch the result
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()

# If the condition is met, execute your Python code
if result:
    # Your Python code here
    pass

Step 1: Enable MySQL event scheduler if it's not enabled already.

SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;

Step 2: Create a new event using the CREATE EVENT command. You need to provide a unique event name, a time schedule using the AT or EVERY clause, and an action to execute your Python script.

For example, let's assume that your Python script is named myscript.py and is located in the /home/user/scripts directory.

CREATE EVENT my_event
ON SCHEDULE AT '2022-05-01 00:00:00' -- Change this to the desired date and time
DO
BEGIN
    !/usr/bin/python3 /home/user/scripts/myscript.py;
END;

Step 3: Make sure that the MySQL event scheduler is enabled and the event is created successfully. You can do this by querying the event_scheduler system variable and the events table in the information_schema database.

SELECT @@event_scheduler;

USE information_schema;
SELECT * FROM events;

from datetime import datetime

# Get the current date and time
current_datetime = datetime.now()

# Convert the current date and time to a string
current_datetime_str = current_datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

# Your Python code to execute based on the current date and time
print("Current date and time:", current_datetime_str)


By combining these two steps, you can create a trigger in your MySQL database that will execute your Python script based on the date provided in your Python code.
