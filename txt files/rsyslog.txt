Configure Centralized rsyslog Server in RHEL:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
rsyslog is responsible for log processing in RHEL. rsyslog is abbreviation of ‘Rocket Fast System for Log processing’.
rsyslog offers high-performance, great security features and modular design. It can accept input from wide variety
of sources, transform it and output the result to diverse destinations.

In this article, we will configure a central logging server using rsyslog on RHEL and then we will configure RHEL 
clients to submit their local logs to this rsyslog based central logging server.

Environment Specification:
We are using two virtual machines, one as the rsyslog server and the other as the rsyslog client.
SERVER IP Address: 192.168.1.180 (RHEL 7.7)
CLIENT IP Address: 192.168.1.170 (RHEL 7.3)

Configuring rsyslog Server on RHEL 7.7:
---------------------------------------------------
1. rsyslog is by default installed on most of the Linux distros including RHEL/CentOS.
Connect to rsyslog server and check status of rsyslog.service, start it if it is not running. (Install the package from repository if there is no such service present)
rpm -qi rsyslog
systemctl start rsyslog.service
systemctl enable rsyslog.service
systemctl status rsyslog.service

2. Now we are configuring rsyslog settings to accept input from other machines.
vim /etc/rsyslog.conf
Find and uncomment following two directives.
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514

Save settings.

3. Now restart the rsyslog.service.
systemctl restart rsyslog.service

4. Allow rsyslog service port in Linux firewall and reload the firewall.
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload

Our rsyslog server has been configured to received input from other log sources via port 514/tcp.

Configuring rsyslog Client on RHEL 7.3:
---------------------------------------------------
1. Connect to rsyslogclient.nehraclasses and check status of rsyslog.service, start & enable it if not running.
rpm -qi rsyslog
systemctl start rsyslog.service
systemctl enable rsyslog.service
systemctl start rsyslog.service

2. Now configure rsyslog client to transmit its log to our rsyslog server by adding the following directives in /etc/rsyslog.conf
vim /etc/rsyslog.conf
. 192.168.1.180:514

3. Restart the rsyslog.service to apply changes.
systemctl restart rsyslog.service

Our rsyslog client has been configured.
=========================================

Now connect to our rsyslog server and check /var/log/messages
tail /var/log/messages

We can see that client is forwarding its logs to server.

We have successfully configure a central login server using rsyslog on CentOS 7.
